# Bulls-and-Cows

This is a simple console game "Bulls and Cows".

The user enters the length of the secret code and the number of possible symbols (max 0-9, a-z).
The program generates the random sequence of symbols for the given length from the chosen number of symbols.
Then the user tryes to guess this secret code entering a guess to the console.
The program gives a grade telling how much bulls and cows there are in the user's guess:
  bull - right symbol on the right place;
  cow - right symbol on the wrong place.

The game ends when the number of bulls is equal to the length (all right symbols are on the right places).
